DIRECTIONS:
Press any of the arrow keys to start the game. Use the arrow keys to move the monster from left to right or up and down. The goal is to eat the cookies that falls from the shelf before they reach the floor.  Move the monster using the arrow keys so that it collides with the falling cookies. If the cookies reach the floor before you can get to them, the game is over.
Good Luck!
